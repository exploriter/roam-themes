# Roam Themes

It's no secret that [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) has taken the personal knowledge management and productivity world by storm. The note-taking app is currently the best-in-class when it comes to organizing notes, ideas, and facilitating insight between them.

While their team is prolific when it comes to new and improved features, the design remains somewhat lackluster. This gives the community (or, [#roamcult](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult)) the opportunity to fill that design void.

If you're looking to give your Roam database a little personality and visual hierarchy, here are some of my favorite theme customizations.

- [Exploriter Theme](https://github.com/exploriter/roam-themes/tree/master/exploriter)

## How to use

1. Roam looks for your custom styles on a specific, case-sensitive page where all your themes will be housed called: `roam/css`
2. Create a `[[Exploriter]]` title block.
3. Indented under the title, add a **Code Block** using the `/` menu and set the syntax to `css`.
4. Open up one of the theme folders above and copy the CSS into your code block.
