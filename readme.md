# Roam Themes

### Quick and dirty installation

Add this to your `[[roam/css]]` page in a CSS Code Block.

```css
@import url('https://exploriter.github.io/roam-themes/core.css');
```

**Note**: Only light/dark color scheme supported in the above method (based on your system settings). See the [public Exploriter Roam graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/exp-pub/page/2VZefaymQ) for a theme preview, modular installation instructions, and full color scheme support.
